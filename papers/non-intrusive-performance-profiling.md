# Non-intrusive Performance Profiling for Entire Software Stacks based on the Flow Reconstruction Principle

Novelty:
- Our approach is the first to be able to construct a system model of an entire software stack without any built-in domain knowledge.
- We propose the first non-intrusive method that enables diagnosis of complex cross-component failures.
- Our method focuses on objects, their relationships and interactions as a way to deal with complexity (as op- posed to focusing on events). Complexity is managed, for example, by initially displaying only high-level objects until a user decides to drill down on target objects.
